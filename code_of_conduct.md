A primary goal of the southampton.digital community is to be inclusive to the
largest number of participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds
possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability,
ethnicity, favourite editor, socioeconomic status, preferred programming
language and religion (or lack thereof).

When participating in southampton.digital via our Slack chat, our GitHub
repositories, or when representing us at events we expect you to:

- be welcoming
- be careful in the words that you choose - you cannot chose how others
  interpret your words
- behave respectfully towards other people
- be considerate of people's time and attention
- contribute positively and constructively to discussions (online or in-person)
- when a disagreement occurs, try to understand why - resolve differing views
  constructively

Logs and Records
----------------

**Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public**.
We cannot prevent people from screencapping or otherwise logging this Slack. We
also can't guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in
devices are secure. Files uploaded here can be downloaded by anyone with a
login. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information
that could harm you or others if it became public.

Because this is a free slack account, we have restricted scrollback, but
Slack--the company--retains complete logs of all channels and direct messages
back to the creation of the southampton.digital Slack.

Slack is a U.S. company and therefore subject to subpoenas from U.S. courts.
Our logs may be subject to subpoena and could become public as part of legal
proceedings.


Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
-------------------------------------

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, **including staff and those
with decision-making authority**, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, we may take any action
deemed appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion
from the community without warning.

Reporting Guidelines
--------------------

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
concerns, please notify us as soon as possible by pinging an [admin](/admins)
on Slack.
